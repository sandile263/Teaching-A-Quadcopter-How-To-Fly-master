# Teaching A Quadcopter How To Fly

This study corresponds to the fourth project of the nanodegree *Machine Learning Engineer*, schooled by **Udacity, Inc.** (https://eu.udacity.com), a for-profit educational organization offering massive open online courses.

Its goal is to teach a quadcopter how to fly thanks to reinforcement learning.

In this repository, you will find the following files and folders:
* The file ***teaching-a-quadcopter-how-to-fly.ipynb***, the Jupyter Notebook which contains all the detailed and explained study, accompanied by the results obtained;
* The files ***task.py*** and ***proper_task.py***, the detailed information about the tasks we want our reinforcement agent to perform;
* The file ***physics_sim.py***, the physical laws that modelize the phenomenon we want to simulate in this study;
* The folder *agents*, which contains specific files corresponding to the reinforcement agent we have built;
* The folder *assets*, which contains specific elements illustrating the Jupyter Notebook provided in this repository;
* The folder *results*, which contains the result files obtained during the processing of the Jupyter Notebook provided in this repository.

Finally, to conclude, respectively to the requirements, it can be said that the reinforcement agent built within this study has been constructed thanks to **Keras** (https://keras.io), the deep learning library capable of running on top of **TensorFlow**, the deep learning framework mainly supported and developed by **Google** (https://www.tensorflow.org).
